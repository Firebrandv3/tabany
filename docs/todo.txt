Just use one version of underscore rather than local AND on server?
On join and resource loading complete emit to the server that you have joined successfully, that way you can still "the player has joined message."


Client-server collisions
  On client move, entities will move locally immediately. Client socket will emit the move/directionChange event and node will broadcast the move to all other clients.
  Client will tell server whether it believes it can move. The server will (or will not) apply the change actually. Then if the client was right, do nothing. If the client was wrong, his gamestate had lagged and he had not known that another Entity had got in his way; so send down a correction on the player's own position.

Sprites
  Remove shadows from some sprites, test others for ricketyness.

Tilesets
  Remove the raised property, it can be emulated in other ways seamlessly.
