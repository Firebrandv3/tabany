Images
======

Because of the large combined size of Tabany's image assets, instead of being included in the project repository they are available for download at http://tabany.zxq.net/images.tar.gz.

Run the following commands to download, extract and install them.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/tabany/tools/
$ chmod +x download_images.sh
$ ./download_images.sh
```


Image Credits
-------------

Credits for this project's image assets are available at gamefiles/images/CREDITS (after they are downloaded, of course). These assets are NOT licensed under the same terms as Tabany's code. In order to use those assets you must follow the specific requirements of their creators, which are specified at the urls listed in CREDITS. Copying the CREDITS file into your project MAY suffice, but you should navigate to the creators' pages to confirm that you are properly crediting them.
